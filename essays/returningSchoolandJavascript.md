My first forays into the exotic world of JavaScript began in 2017, when I needed to know just enough JavaScript language to create simple game tutorials for GenCyber Hawaii. At the time, programming was a side hobby: something that I would do when I was done with my other work (i.e. in teaching microbiology) and after I was tired of messing around with the piano and singing. So, while 2017 was uneventful and my GenCyber Hawaii experience went smoothly, JavaScript was a language I never thought about again until now – 2020.
	So, fast-forward to 2020 and I am now back at school again, this time as a computer science major. My new immediate goal: to complete prerequisites to apply for the MS in CS program at UH Manoa. My reason: increasing my future job opportunities, either as a teacher, or as a software engineer. And in the past two weeks, my resolve has waxed and waned more than twice. The culprit: ICS 314. The language of the course: JavaScript.
	In ICS 314, students are immediately flung into intense workout sessions (called “Workouts of the Day”) to experience athletic software engineering. The descriptor “athletic” is accurate – for high-performance is not only evaluated by accuracy, but also in speed and skill. There are many ways a student could solve a Workout of the Day. But workout topics are spontaneous and require a high level of problem-solving to choose the most efficient approach. In the first workouts, I realized that I had never challenged myself to solve programming problems within a time limit. And under a time limit, my accuracy dropped considerably and I couldn’t remember some of the basics of JavaScript code. So, it is with newfound humility that I share with you my three newest lessons with JavaScript.
	Firstly, JavaScript is flexible. You can define variables by how they are first used, rather than having to be strictly typed, as with Java. This can be quite useful for the budding programmer who would rather spend time creating a functional program than worrying about getting the type correct. This can also be quite dangerous when you test for equality with double equals, “==”, since that will make the string “1” and the number 1 equivalent. This can lead to hard to track errors in the code.
	Secondly, JavaScript looks deceptively easy to use. JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the word – partly because it is useful in web programming. However, its high accessibility has made abundant bad examples of code online. Bad code might work, but when you try to add features, errors that are hard to track can occur. I seem to find more examples of bad code written in JavaScript than in Java.
	Thirdly, there is a lot of good that can be done with JavaScript. Once I had the opportunity to review more of the JavaScript basics, I was able to write programs more quickly than ever before with other languages. My latest experiences were therefore enjoyable and my resolve towards becoming a better programmer once again strengthened.
	In conclusion, it has been an exciting two weeks. I had to relearn much of the JavaScript I had learned before because there had been such a long break in my programming. The instructor for ICS 314 is encouraging and showed us ways of increasing our programming efficiency. So, I am looking forward to the rest of ICS 314 and learning more JavaScript.
