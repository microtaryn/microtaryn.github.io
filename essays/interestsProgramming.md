## But aren't you already a microbiologist?
I’ve been recently asked, “Why programming? Isn’t it enough to be a microbiologist?” Well, yes, I am happy with my job teaching microbiology. There is also a zen to certain lab work and it is always exciting to hear/read about new research and new techniques. But I am also acutely aware of the growing impact computer programming has on all fields, including microbiology. Programming experience may not be a prerequisite now, but the ability to solve problems, even biological ones, via the computer is the nearby future. 

## Immediate Goals
I am interested in web programming because many companies are using web interfaces for their marketing and advertising as well as for training their employees. Therefore, I believe that a marketable skill would be to be able to design and create web interfaces.

Secondly, I am interested in databases and database management. This is because there is an increasing amount of information being stored somewhere on the Cloud and being able to display that data requires an understanding of retrieving the data from the Cloud. This is consistent with learning web programming since part of web programming can involve creating a web interface to a backend database

## Skills I Hope to Develop

I hope to be able to utilize JavaScript to make web interfaces that can dynamically interact with the users to provide a better user experience.
