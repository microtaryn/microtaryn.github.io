summary: Programming computers are great! Composing songs (aka programming musical "code") is fun too! Here is a list of my original song compositions :)

## My Songs
I have been singing my whole life, but after attending the 2018 Hawaii Songwriting Festival, I was inspired to write songs of my own that I could sing and perform. These songs are mostly for me, my family and friends. But to date, they also represent some of my most significant projects in planning and collaboration. If you want to check them out, here is a playlist: [TE Taryn Originals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY-sWJjgXT81AN9v3nW3O4v-QWKxnlHI_)

## Programming's Parallel with Composing
I am no expert in composing or programming - there is a lot that I want to learn about both. But if you, like me, enjoy some form of music (eg. pop, R&B, reggae, jazz, rock, country, classical, techno etc.) and are looking for some connection between the two, here are some reasons why I think the disciplines are complementary to each other:

Both programming and composing songs requires innovation and a certain level of skill. The composer, like the programmer, must build upon her previous experience, and strive to weave together different ideas to make a product that is user-friendly (i.e. catering to an audience) yet unique (i.e. there should be no copied code without attribution). Both studies typically involve collaborative efforts and both must follow a set of rules. For example, all programming languages have a syntax and their interpretation (by the computer) relies upon a combination of symbols and expressions. A musical score also has its own set of rules - musical notes have set values and each chord uses certain notes. There are many ways to create usable computer functions. There are many ways to combine chords in different chord progressions. But for both disciplines, there are more standard approaches and preferred methods towards achieving the same goal. Only a handful of programming approaches to a problem are efficient. And only certain chord progressions have remained popular throughout time.

It has also been a dream of mine to sing/compose for cartoons and video games. So, if you are interested in collaborating, send me a message!
