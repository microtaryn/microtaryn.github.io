I’ve been recently asked, “Why programming? Isn’t it enough to be a microbiologist?” Well, yes, I am happy with my job teaching microbiology. There is also a zen to certain lab work and it is always exciting to hear/read about new research and new techniques.

Programming experience may not be a prerequisite now, but the ability to solve problems, even biological ones, via the computer is the nearby future.
